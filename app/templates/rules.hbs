    <li>WE ARE RESPECTFUL TO ALL MEMBERS</li>
    <li>YOUR 1st ATTACK IS YOUR MIRROR BASE ON THE OPPOSITIONS CLAN (ie;....if you're #10 on the war map...you attack #10...#15 attacks #15 ect ect...) THEN HOLD UNTIL AFTER THE 12hr MARK FOR 2nd ATTACK WHEN THE LEADER OR A CO WILL GIVE YOU YOUR NEXT ATTACK NUMBER... #### FIRST ATTACK SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE THE 12th HOUR ####</li>
    <li>USE BOTH ATTACKS IN WAR</li>
