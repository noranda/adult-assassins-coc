# Clan Rules

1. WE MAX OUT OUR TH's BEFORE WE MOVE TO THE NEXT TH...(thats troop lvl's,spells,defences,walls ect...( if in doubt ask the Leader a CO or an elder)
2. WE ARE RESPECTFUL TO ALL MEMBERS
3. YOUR 1st ATTACK IS YOUR MIRROR BASE ON THE OPPOSITIONS CLAN (ie;....if you're #10 on the war map...you attack #10...#15 attacks #15 ect ect...) THEN HOLD UNTIL AFTER THE 12hr MARK FOR 2nd ATTACK WHEN THE LEADER OR A CO WILL GIVE YOU YOUR NEXT ATTACK NUMBER... #### FIRST ATTACK SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE THE 12th HOUR ####
4. USE BOTH ATTACKS IN WAR
5. **# ONLY DESIGNATED MEMBERS ARE TO FILL WAR CC's.#** (clan mail will be sent for the donators as it will change each war,where they will be given set numbers to fill...this is a clan effort done by the HIGHER TH's ONLY)
6. WE DO NOT HAVE A DONATION RATIO...JUST WHAT YOU CAN WHEN YOU CAN IS ALL THAT'S ASKED OF ALL MEMBERS...( if you have a specific request..state it in your request as all members are encouraged to donate and do so...)
7. CLASH ON HAVE FUN AND MAKE SOME NEW FRIENDS....
