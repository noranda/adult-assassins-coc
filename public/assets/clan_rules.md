# Clan Rules

#### Clan Conduct

* **Be respectful** to all members

#### Town Hall Upgrades

* You must max out your base before upgrading to the next town hall level
  * This includes upgrading all: Walls, Troops, Spells, Defenses, Gold Mines, Elixir Collectors, Gold Storages, Elixir Storages
* When in doubt, ask a Leader if you can upgrade

#### War Tactics

* Your first attack should be done within the first **10 hours** of war (before the clock hits 14:00 remaining). Your second attack should be done after the **12 hour** mark. When you are ready to do your second attack ask a Leader of Co-Leader who to attack.
* Your first attack should be against your mirror base on the oppositions clan. For example, if you are #15 then you attack #15, if you are #33 you attack #33, etc.
* You must use **both attacks** in war, no excuses.
* Only **designated members** are to fill War CC's. Clan Mail will be sent for each war informing who the donors are and who they will donate to. This is a clan effort from the higher level members to ensure the best possible defense for each war.

#### Donations

* We **do not** have a donation ratio. All we ask is that you donate what you can when you can.
* If a member asks for something specific, please respect that request.
